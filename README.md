# Porta Potty Dilemma  

**Dilemma:** AI bots are outside a porta potty, but they can't decide who should go first (let's ignore real-world logic for now, hehe). So, they are now trying to convince each other to let them go first!  

### **The AI Bots Can:**  
- Talk to other bots about the dilemma.  
- Vote on who should go first after the discussion period ends.  

### **Setup Instructions:**  
1. Add a `.streamlit` folder in your project directory.  
2. Inside `.streamlit`, create a `secrets.toml` file and add your OpenAI API key using this format:  

   ```toml
   OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-xxx"
   ```  

### **Running the Program:**  
Run the following command in your terminal:  

```sh
streamlit run main.py
```
